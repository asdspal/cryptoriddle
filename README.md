# CryptoRiddle

CryptoRiddle is an interactive blockchain-themed word guessing game built as a Farcaster Frame. It leverages the Onchain AI Oracle (OAO) to generate puzzles, hints, and explanations, providing an engaging and educational experience for blockchain enthusiasts.  

## Game Mechanics

1. **Puzzle Generation**: 
   - The game uses OAO to generate a random blockchain term (maximum 2 words).
   - An abstract image description related to the term is also generated.

2. **Guessing**:
   - Players attempt to guess the blockchain term.
   - After each guess, feedback is provided:
     - ðŸŸ© Green: Correct letter in the correct position
     - ðŸŸ¨ Yellow: Correct letter in the wrong position
     - â¬œ White: Letter not in the word

3. **Hints**:
   - Players can request hints if they're stuck.
   - Hints are generated by OAO and provide clues without directly revealing the term.

4. **Reveal Answer**:
   - If players give up, they can reveal the answer.
   - OAO provides a simple explanation of the blockchain term.

5. **Scoring**:
   - Players earn points based on how quickly they solve the puzzle.
   - Using fewer hints results in a higher score.
